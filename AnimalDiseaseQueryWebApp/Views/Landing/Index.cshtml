    <ul>
        <li>Is it possible to build mobile apps that use simple clinical signs to support animal health workers in making accurate diagnoses and treating common diseases?</li>
        <li>How can the data collected by such apps be most effectively integrated into the systems that inform animal health policy at district, country and global levels?</li>
        <li>Can ontology-based approaches assist the process of integrating externally generated data and knowledge into these types of mHealth apps?</li>
    </ul>

            These are just some of the questions being explored as part of this project. <br />
            You can find more details by clicking the 'About the project' button below. <br />
            You can also use the 'Diagnose animal' button to access a web-based tool that illustrates the basic functionality of an app currently being field tested in Ethiopia. <br />
            While the 'Visualise cases' button provides graphics that summarise the cases collected to date using the app.
